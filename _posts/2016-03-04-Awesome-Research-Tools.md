## Publishing and Sharing


Make use of [GitHub](http://github.com) to cooperate with others. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) is also good for hosting static contents.


### Writing

**Markdown is one of the best languages for writing.**

* [Cloud Based Markdown Editors](#cloud-services)

* [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/): Integrated with Jekyll and turns markdown posts automatically. Jekyll is a tool for blogging.
* [GitHub](http://github.com): Just put markdown, restructuredtext, pdf or ipython notebook files on GitHub. All these formats can be previewed online. **The thing to mention is that the math in ipython notebook can rendered on GitHub.**





### Blog and CMS

Before doing the investigation on platforms, just remind yourself:

**I want to write, not run blogging software.**


**Blog/CMS Softwares**

These softwares are running on the server and can be

* [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) (`PHP`): Very popular but requires a lot of maintenance.
* [Ghost](https://github.com/tryghost/Ghost) (`Node.js`): Open, Simple, non-profit; write with markdown and live preview.

**These Blog/CMS softwares can be hosted on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).**




### Static Generator

[Here is a nice website](https://staticsitegenerators.net/) that tells you all the static site generators.

* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) (`Ruby`): most widely used one I guess; easy to deply.
* [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) (`Ruby`): easier to use compared with jekyll; somewhat compatable with Jekyll.
* [Hexo](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo) (`Node.js`)
